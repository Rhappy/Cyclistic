    "<p> Cyclistic is an American company, located in Chicago, Illinois, founded in 2016, focused on bike sharing. The company has 5,824 bicycles distributed in a network of 692 stations, places that allow unlocking a bicycle at one location and returning it at another.</p>\n",
    "<p> The following types of bicycles are available for rent: </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traditional bicycles**: Two-wheel model with the traditional shape.\n",
    "- **Reclining bikes**: Including model with two wheels where the stool is replaced by a seat with backrest slightly reclined backwards, where the user, when sitting down, positions the handlebars between the legs and uses the pedals that are at the front of the front wheel to start the movement.\n",
    "- **Cargo bike**: Inclusive model of bike with support for objects.\n",
    "- **Manual tricycles**: Inclusive model of seat tricycle with backrest where the steering handlebar also has a rotating mechanism similar to the traditional pedal, but to be used with the hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>According to previous data, about 8% of users use alternative models to traditional bicycles. It is also known that around 30% use one of the models to go to work, while the rest are dedicated to leisure.</p>\n",

    "<p>As we performed the analysis, patterns between casual users and members became evident. First, it is appropriate to note that the data provided is not registration data, making it difficult to estimate the number of people who are members and the number who use the service casually. The databases only provide data on trips, making the first three items of the analysis potentially questionable, so that, for example, a greater amount of trips made by members does not necessarily mean that there are more members than casual users, as a single member can take hundreds of trips per year while hundreds of casual users can take one trip each.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Taking these questions into account, the analyzes of items 5.2.4 to 5.2.6 are fully relevant, where we observe patterns of trips filtered by type of user. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The first suggestion for action to enable the increase in subscription members would be to invest in a greater diversity of plans. Currently, there is only one type of annual plan (Cyclistic members) while casual users choose between a single trip or a day pass. Taking into account that many casual users use the service for outings, a valid possibility would be to create plans that include more than one person per subscription and launch plans in shorter periods, of 1 month and 3 months. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Another interesting approach would be to provide seasonal promotional situations, bearing in mind that there are periods of greater use in the year, taking advantage of the warm climate to encourage the use of bicycles for outdoor activities. For example, a promotion can be created in July with special conditions such as longer usage time without paying an additional fee, or creating a partnership that grants discounts on products such as soft drinks and ice cream, which are very popular at this time of year.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>There is also the possibility of recording routes taken by the person in his personal account. There is a tendency for applications related to physical health that record routes via GPS where the user can share the route, counting the distance and the time the route was taken. Such an action could bring a greater adherence of users who are looking for a way to exercise together with a tool for monitoring and sharing on social networks according to the user's initiative. Taking advantage of the premise of health and well-being, it is also possible to use promotional plans to attract more users at other times and an advertising campaign that suggests the benefits of introducing physical activities on the bicycle in everyday life, encouraging use in routine tasks such as commuting to and from work and taking short trips throughout the day.</p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It is estimated that a considerable portion of casual users is formed by tourists in view of popular stations in tourist spots. Due to the transient nature of this category, there is not a good predictability to make them members of the bicycle rental service. However, one way to attract more public attention would be to suggest popular routes aimed at historic and tourist areas of the city of Chicago, possibly with itineraries to be performed divided into a few hours based on the departure location. So you can turn a casual bike ride into an experience to be had when visiting Chicago. </p>"

    "<p>The service is offered through a partnership between a company that performs the maintenance and replacement of bicycles, as well as the development and maintenance of the application, with the City of Chicago, Illinois. The data provided by this partnership suggest different behavioral patterns between casual users and members, so that the search for user loyalty may not seem simple.</p>\n",

Marketing actions in conjunction with the creation of additional plans, seasonal promotions, registration and ride sharing system, and tour routes can both increase Chicago's permanent citizen base and membership share and encourage greater use of casual users of passing through the city.</p>"
